## Description

The Game About People is where we first debuted BiTi to the world and thus the name of my personal LLC (BiTi LLC) was born.
The focus of this game is to get to know your friends better, and get to know which of your friends knows you best.
The Game About People is a fun multiplayer game and is a hit at parties where you want to see just how well you all know each other.

## Technical Stack Used

The Game About People was developed using the GoDot engine for the mobile
platforms, and a Ruby on Rails backend serving websocket connections for
the multiplayer aspect of the game.
