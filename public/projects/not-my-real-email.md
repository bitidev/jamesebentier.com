## Description

Not My Real Email offers users a secure and convenient solution to protect their online privacy by
creating email aliases or masks over their existing email addresses, perfect for those seeking heightened
anonymity and safety in their online activities.

## Technical Stack Used

Not My Real Email was developed using a combination of a Ruby on Rails for the
control interface, allowing for users to log in, create aliases, and manage their
account settings, and a SMTP stack built on top of Postfix and Dovecot for the
handling of email aliases and forwarding.
